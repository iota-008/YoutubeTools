the eight-year-old boy asked his father
dad what's the shortest way to checkmate
in chess
the dad said two moves my son two moves
can there be a checkmate in two moves
the son was very surprised the dad said
look i'll show you
you go f3 black plays e5
you go g4 and now the queen swoops in
and gives a check to the king and it's
checkmate
the king cannot go anywhere it's covered
by all the
white pieces and on this diagonal
it has been opened up completely
the sun quietly moved away his
tournament was coming up tomorrow
he started to think i'm white tomorrow
how can i make use of this trap
he thought for the entire night about
this pattern
and next day morning he opened the game
with one d4
his opponent played f5 and suddenly
the boy started to think look one door
has opened up
to the king but if i play a move like e3
he's not going to play g5 and allow me
to checkmate
over here which is the fool's mate which
he had been shown by his father
yesterday so he laid the track down
he played his bishop to g5 the opponent
went for the move h6
now he moved his bishop back to h4
there came the move g5
and here he came back once again
and his opponent was so happy because
the bishop is trapped here
on g3 so he pushed his pawn to f4
and he got up from his chair the
youngster
the eight-year-old boy sat with his
head in his hand and found the move
e3 and there the opponent said
wow a free bishop now he took the bishop
and the queen came out and there you
have it
it's a checkmate just like how he had
learned from his dad
a few hours ago the boy managed to use
that same concept
but in a different opening the dutch
defense and that's what i say through
these
this trap series you don't need to learn
everything move by move
what you need to learn are the patterns
look at this checkmate it's on a
diagonal
and if you can remember these patterns
it will take
place in your games as well this is
sagarsha signing off
i wish you good luck bye
